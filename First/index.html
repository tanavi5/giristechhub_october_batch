                    Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere 
                    or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements
                    and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature,
                    human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright
                    separate and even superior to nature.[2]</p>

                    During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became 
                    the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial 
                    revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional
                    intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American 
                    transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). 
                    However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same
                    time, especially after Charles Darwin.[2]
